## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Node.js & Express**: Server setup and API handling
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user information and progress
- **Cors**: Cross-origin resource sharing for client-server interactions

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI for interactive learning experiences
- **React Router**: Navigation across various app pages
- **Context API**: State management for handling lessons and user data
- **Axios**: API calls to backend for lesson generation and user data retrieval

---

## Application Flow
1. **Login/Sign-Up**: Users begin by logging in or creating an account, gaining access to their unique dashboard.
2. **Dashboard**: Shows user‚Äôs progress, leaderboard ranking, and available languages.
3. **Language Selection**: Clicking "Choose Language" directs users to a page where they select a language to learn.
4. **Lesson Generation**: Based on the chosen language, the frontend triggers a backend route (`/api/lessons/generate`), which uses the Gemini API to create relevant lessons.
5. **Learning and Gameplay**: Users engage with lessons and practice vocabulary through the Asteroid Quiz Game and other activities.

## Asteroid Quiz Game
The **Asteroid Quiz Game** is designed as a vocabulary practice module where users match words with their translations. 

### How to Play:
1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button.
2. **Match Words and Translations**: Asteroids with vocabulary words will descend from the top of the screen. Your task is to select the correct translation from the options before the asteroid reaches the bottom.
3. **Score Points**: Each correct answer earns points. The game increases in difficulty as your score rises, making it more challenging to keep up with new words.
4. **End of Game**: The game ends after a set time or when a certain number of asteroids reach the bottom without being answered.

## Backend
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, providing endpoints for user authentication, lesson generation, and progress tracking.

### File Structure:
- `app.js`: Initializes the Express server, connects to the database, and sets up routes.
- `/routes/userRoutes.js`: Handles user-related routes, such as login and signup.
- `/routes/lessonRoutes.js`: Manages lesson generation and retrieval.
- `/config/dbconfig.js`: MongoDB configuration and connection setup.

### Backend Routes
- **`/api/users`**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
- **`/api/lessons/generate`**: Calls the Gemini API to dynamically generate lessons based on the user's selected language.

---

## Frontend
The frontend is developed using **React** and utilizes **React Router** for navigation.

### File Structure:
- `App.jsx`: Defines routes and wraps the app in the LessonsProvider for state management.
- `/pages`: Contains the main pages like HomePage, AuthPage, Dashboard, and Game.
- `/context/LessonsContext.js`: Provides global state for lessons and user progress.
  
### Frontend Routes
- **`/auth`**: Authentication page for login/sign-up.
- **`/dashboard`**: User‚Äôs main dashboard displaying language options, leaderboard, and progress.
- **`/language`**: Language selection page to choose a new language for learning.
